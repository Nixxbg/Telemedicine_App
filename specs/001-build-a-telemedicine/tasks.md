# Tasks: Telemedicine Application

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-build-a-telemedicine/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (✓), research.md (✓), data-model.md (✓), contracts/ (✓)

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Implementation plan loaded: Next.js frontend + FastAPI backend + PostgreSQL
   → Extract: TypeScript/React frontend, Python/FastAPI backend, Docker containers
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: 8 core entities (User, Patient, Doctor, MedicalRecord, etc.)
   → contracts/: 4 API contract files (auth, medical-records, appointments, messaging)
   → research.md: Tech stack decisions and security requirements
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Docker environment, backend/frontend init, database setup
   → Tests: Contract tests for all 4 API modules, integration tests
   → Core: Authentication, medical records versioning, appointment booking, messaging
   → Integration: Database connections, JWT middleware, real-time messaging
   → Polish: Security audit, performance optimization, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different modules/files = mark [P] for parallel execution
   → Same entity/file = sequential dependencies
   → All tests before implementation (TDD approach)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T060)
6. Generate dependency graph for complex medical record versioning
7. Create parallel execution groups for independent API modules
8. Validate completeness: All contracts tested, all entities modeled, all endpoints implemented
9. Return: SUCCESS (60 tasks ready for telemedicine application development)
```

## Parallel Execution Groups

### Group A: Contract Tests (T008-T022)

```
# All contract tests can run simultaneously - different API modules
Task: "Contract test POST /api/v1/auth/register in backend/tests/contract/test_auth_register.py"
Task: "Contract test GET /api/v1/medical-records in backend/tests/contract/test_medical_records_list.py"
Task: "Contract test POST /api/v1/appointments in backend/tests/contract/test_appointments_create.py"
Task: "Contract test WebSocket /ws/messages in backend/tests/contract/test_messages_websocket.py"
```

### Group B: Database Models (T027-T033)

```
# All models can be developed in parallel - different entities
Task: "User base model in backend/src/models/user.py"
Task: "MedicalRecord with versioning in backend/src/models/medical_record.py"
Task: "Appointment model in backend/src/models/appointment.py"
Task: "Message model in backend/src/models/message.py"
```

### Group C: Frontend Components (T046-T052)

```
# UI components can be built in parallel - different features
Task: "Authentication components in frontend/src/components/auth/"
Task: "Medical questionnaire components in frontend/src/components/questionnaire/"
Task: "Appointment booking components in frontend/src/components/appointments/"
Task: "Messaging interface in frontend/src/components/messaging/"
```

## Medical Domain Considerations

### HIPAA Compliance Tasks

- T059: Security headers, encryption at rest/transit
- T060: Audit trail for all medical record access
- T065: Data retention policies and automated cleanup

### Medical Record Versioning

- T025: Integration test for versioning behavior
- T030: Immutable versioning in database model
- T036: Service layer versioning logic
- T040: API endpoints for version history

### Clinical Workflow

- T048: Medical questionnaire with partial completion
- T049: Doctor dashboard with patient context
- T051: Secure messaging for consultations
- T052: Chronological medical history display

## Validation Checklist

- ✅ All 4 API contracts have comprehensive tests (T008-T022)
- ✅ All 7 core entities have models and services (T027-T038)
- ✅ All major user journeys have integration tests (T023-T026)
- ✅ Security and compliance requirements addressed (T057-T060)
- ✅ Medical domain requirements covered (versioning, questionnaire, HIPAA)
- ✅ Performance and polish phase included (T061-T067)

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files/modules, no dependencies - safe for parallel execution
- **TDD Critical**: All tests (T008-T026) must be written and failing before implementation starts
- **Medical Records**: Complex versioning system requires careful integration testing
- **Real-time**: WebSocket implementation for messaging requires backend-frontend coordination
- **Security**: HIPAA compliance is mandatory - cannot be optional or delayed
- **Testing Strategy**: Contract tests → Integration tests → Implementation → Unit tests
