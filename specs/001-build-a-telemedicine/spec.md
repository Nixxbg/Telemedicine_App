# Feature Specification: Telemedicine Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-telemedicine`  
**Created**: September 10, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a telemedicine application where patients can maintain their medical records and book consultations with doctors. Patients can create profiles with their medical history, current medications, and personal information. The booking system allows patients to select from available doctors and choose appointment time slots. Doctors have their own dashboard to manage appointment availability and view patient information. The app includes a messaging system for communication between patients and doctors, and doctors can add consultation notes to patient records after appointments. Medical records are organized chronologically and can be updated by both patients and doctors with appropriate permissions."

**Clarifications**: Authentication will use JWT tokens. Patients sign up with email and username. Doctors authenticate with email and pre-assigned doctor ID (hardcoded in database). No payment system - appointments are free. Consultations via messaging only (no video/phone calls). Users can specify data retention (minimum 8 weeks, indefinite option, or request deletion). Medical records collected via structured questionnaire during profile setup covering family history, current conditions, procedures, medications, allergies, and drug resistance. Questionnaire allows partial completion and saves progress. Medical history is versioned - updates create new versions while preserving chronological access to all versions. Doctors can view all versions but cannot modify patient-entered data.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

A patient with ongoing health concerns wants to maintain comprehensive medical records digitally and easily book consultations with qualified doctors. They begin by completing a structured questionnaire during profile setup, providing detailed information about their family health history, current conditions, past procedures, medications, allergies, and drug resistance. They can skip questions they're unsure about and return later to complete sections. When needing medical advice, they can browse available doctors, select convenient appointment times, and communicate directly with their chosen healthcare provider via secure messaging. After consultations, their medical records are updated with professional consultation notes, and any updates they make to their health information create new versions while preserving their complete chronological health history for doctors to review.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new user, **When** they register as a patient with email and username, **Then** they are presented with a structured questionnaire to complete their medical profile
2. **Given** a patient is completing the medical questionnaire, **When** they encounter questions they cannot answer, **Then** they can skip those questions and the system saves their progress
3. **Given** a patient has partially completed their medical questionnaire, **When** they return to their profile, **Then** they can continue from where they left off and complete remaining sections
4. **Given** a patient updates their medical history, **When** they save the changes, **Then** a new version is created while preserving all previous versions chronologically
5. **Given** a doctor with a pre-assigned doctor ID, **When** they authenticate with email and doctor ID, **Then** they can access their dashboard
6. **Given** a registered patient, **When** they browse available doctors, **Then** they can view doctor profiles and available appointment slots
7. **Given** a patient selects an appointment slot, **When** they confirm the booking, **Then** the appointment is scheduled and both parties are notified (no payment required)
8. **Given** a doctor is logged in, **When** they access their dashboard, **Then** they can view upcoming appointments and patient information
9. **Given** a doctor views a patient's medical history, **When** they access the records, **Then** they can see all versions chronologically but cannot modify patient-entered information
10. **Given** a patient and doctor have an appointment, **When** they use the messaging system, **Then** they can communicate securely via text messages (no video or phone calls)
11. **Given** a patient is adding medical records, **When** they specify a data retention period, **Then** they can choose minimum 8 weeks, indefinite storage, or request deletion at any time
12. **Given** a consultation is completed, **When** the doctor adds consultation notes, **Then** the notes are added to the patient's chronological medical record
13. **Given** a patient or doctor (with permissions), **When** they update medical records, **Then** the changes are recorded with appropriate audit trail

### Edge Cases

- What happens when appointment slots conflict or become unavailable after selection?
- How does the system handle emergency consultation requests outside normal booking?
- What occurs when a patient or doctor cancels an appointment?
- How are medical records protected if a user account is compromised?
- What happens when a doctor is unavailable for a scheduled appointment?
- How does the system handle data retention when a user changes their retention preference?
- What happens when a user's data retention period expires?
- What occurs if a patient tries to access the questionnaire after partially completing it from a different device?
- How does the system handle conflicting information when a patient updates their medical history?
- What happens if a doctor attempts to modify patient-entered medical information?
