- Version tracking with timestamp and user audit fields

### Decision: Modular Monolith Architecture

**Rationale**:

- Simpler deployment than microservices for initial version
- Easier data consistency for medical records
- Reduced latency for patient-doctor interactions
- Simpler testing with real database connections
- Can be refactored to microservices later if needed

**Module structure**:

- `auth_service`: JWT authentication, role management
- `medical_records`: Versioned patient data, questionnaires
- `appointments`: Booking, scheduling, availability management
- `messaging`: Secure patient-doctor communication
- `notifications`: Appointment reminders, system alerts

## Database Design

### Decision: PostgreSQL with Versioned Records

**Rationale**:

- ACID compliance critical for medical data integrity
- JSON columns for flexible questionnaire data storage
- Excellent performance for complex queries (medical history searches)
- Built-in UUID support for secure record identifiers
- Strong backup and recovery features for medical data

**Versioning strategy**:

- Separate version table linked to main medical records
- Immutable version records (append-only)
- Trigger-based version creation on updates
- Chronological access with efficient indexing

### Decision: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Rationale**:

- Clear separation between patient and doctor permissions
- Audit trail for medical record access
- Granular permissions for different medical data sections
- Compliance with healthcare data privacy requirements

**Role definitions**:

- Patient: CRUD on own medical records, READ on own appointments/messages
- Doctor: READ on assigned patient records, CRUD on consultation notes
- System: Automated data retention and cleanup operations

## Authentication & Security

### Decision: JWT with Refresh Tokens

**Rationale**:

- Stateless authentication suitable for medical data access
- Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes) for security
- Long-lived refresh tokens (7 days) for user convenience
- Role-based claims in JWT payload
- Secure HTTP-only cookie storage for refresh tokens

**Security measures**:

- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Session invalidation on role changes
- Audit logging for all medical data access

### Decision: Dual Authentication Flows

**Rationale**:

- Patient registration: email + username (self-service)
- Doctor authentication: email + pre-assigned doctor ID (controlled access)
- Different validation requirements for each user type
- Clear separation of user onboarding processes

## Testing Strategy

### Decision: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**Rationale**:

- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle ensures comprehensive coverage
- Critical for medical data accuracy and security
- Contract-first development ensures API consistency
- Real database testing for data integrity validation

**Testing layers**:

1. Contract tests: API schema validation
2. Integration tests: Database operations with real PostgreSQL
3. E2E tests: Complete user workflows (patient registration → appointment booking)
4. Unit tests: Business logic validation

### Decision: Real Dependencies in Tests

**Rationale**:

- Medical data operations require real database validation
- Docker containers for isolated test environments
- Actual PostgreSQL instance for integration tests
- No mocking of critical data operations

## Development Environment

### Decision: Docker-First Development

**Rationale**:

- Consistent environment across team members
- Easy PostgreSQL setup for local development
- Production-like environment for testing
- Simplified CI/CD pipeline configuration

**Container strategy**:

- Multi-stage Dockerfiles for optimized production builds
- Docker Compose for local development orchestration
- Separate containers for frontend, backend, database
- Volume mounting for development hot reloading

## Performance Considerations

### Decision: Caching Strategy

**Rationale**:

- Doctor availability data cached for 5 minutes
- Medical record versions cached after retrieval
- Frontend state management with React Query for API caching
- PostgreSQL query optimization with proper indexing

**Performance targets**:

- API response time: <200ms p95
- Page load time: <2 seconds first paint
- Database queries: <50ms for most operations
- Concurrent users: 1,000 simultaneous without degradation

## Data Retention & Privacy

### Decision: User-Controlled Retention

**Rationale**:

- Minimum 8 weeks retention for medical continuity
- Indefinite storage option for chronic conditions
- On-demand deletion for user privacy rights
